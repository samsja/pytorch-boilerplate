# Boilerplate code for pytorch lightning project to dev with jupyter lab and docker

this boilerplat create a project with the following things:

* pytorch lightnings 
* poetry manage the dependencies
* jupyter lab
* add a dockerfile if needed to either develop or run a script
* use precommit hook for auto formatting before commiting
* use jupytext sync to avoid to commit notebook


## How to use it ?:



This is my personnal boilerplate to avoid copy pasting the same code at each new deep learning project. Feel free to use it, creat an issue, forked it and send a PR !
